# Mixer

The mixer is a subcomponent responsible for receiving audio and video from multiple sources, then broadcasting them to multiple clients. Mixer serves as a middleman between the user and the camera. In the future, it may be extended to support re-encoding the stream to h.264 et al for more thorough browser compatability. 

## Naming
"Mixer" is architecturaly inspired by audio mixers.
